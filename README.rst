robotpy-cscore
==============

These are python bindings for the cscore library, which is a high performance 
library used in the FIRST Robotics competition to serve video to/from robots.
However, the core library is suitable for use in other applications, and is
comparable to something like mjpg-streamer.

This library requires python 3.6+
