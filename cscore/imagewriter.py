class ImageWriter:
    """
    Creates a thread that periodically writes images to a specified
    directory. Useful for looking at images after a match has
    completed.

    The default location is ``/media/sda1/camera``. The folder
    ``/media/sda1`` is the default location that USB drives inserted into
    the RoboRIO are mounted at. The USB drive must have a directory in it
    named ``camera``.

    .. note:: It is recommended to only write images when something useful
              (such as targeting) is happening, otherwise you'll end up
              with a lot of images written to disk that you probably aren't
              interested in.

    Intended usage is::

        self.image_writer = ImageWriter()
